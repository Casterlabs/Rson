# Test Suite

The contents of this folder should be a bunch of Json files, in the same format as @nst 's [test suite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/tree/master/test_parsing).

y_ = Should succeed  
n_ = Shouldn't succeed  
i_ = It's implementation specific if it should succeed or not as the specs for Json say nothing about these cases.
